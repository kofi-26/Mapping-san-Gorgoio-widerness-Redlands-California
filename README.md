# Mapping-san-Gorgoio-widerness-Redlands-California
Title: Mapping the San Gorgonio Wilderness Area, near Redlands, California
Tools: Arc GIS pro, Satellite images, 
Data: Data of endangered species habitat
Goal: Detect the changes of the shoreline over a period of time
Process:
•	A topographic basemap was used 
•	San Gorgono Mountain was selected within the topographic map
•	We used the locator tool to identify the area of location
•	We made a switch to us the imagery basemap for further analysis
•	Added wilderness area in the united states to our area of interest
•	We make a layer from selection from the wilderness areas
•	We change the symbology and colour of the selected layer. This is done by opening its properties.
•	We make a bookmark from the feature.
•	We Navigated to Arcgis online and added data of Endagered species focusing of the area of interest
•	Performed spatial analysis by clipping the habitat layer to the boundary of the wilderness area.


1. Setting out layout and importation of data

2. Removing federal reserves that are not needed from the map.

3. searching the project area using the locateer button

4. Mapping out the wilderness areas in the project area

6. We use select button in Arcgis to select the feature

   <img width="2417" height="1167" alt="7  we use select button under the map to select the feature from this" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f17e444-ba75-41c2-bf37-02dfe3ead8c5" />

7. We make a new layer from the selection we made

8.  We navigate to the symbology and only use the single selection feature

9. Setting the transparency to 30 percent

10. Zoom in to the selected layer

11. We bookmark the selected project to ensure we can navigate to the specific directory

12.  We integrate the data for the National habitat into our map

13. We integrate our reserve with our highly critical habitat areas.

14. We use the geoprocessing tool pairwise clip to clip the critical habitat features to our map

   <img width="2532" height="966" alt="16 pairwise clip tool " src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e54dbcb-fc81-417f-9725-88375c45cf9f" />

15. Setting up the new output layer after clip
